Linkedin.py code is already compilled & result is been stored inside result.csv which later renamed to linkedinScrapped.csv
& I also clean that csv according to my requirements. So if want to recompile uncomment given code & run it. Since it's a crawler
which works over 100's of linkedin profile page so it take time to compile it.

Libraries required to run linkedin.py file (via pip):
pandas
html2text
requests
beautifulsoup4
selenium

Libraries required to run remain projec is given in requirement.txt
